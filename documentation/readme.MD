# Documentation for CBI coding

This folder contains Word documents that show the portions of the central bank law from which the coding for each indicator was dervied. We include this information to make our coding of each indicator transparent. 

The documents are broadly organized by region, as indicated by the file name. The <a href='scores2021_pt1.docx'>scores2021_pt1.docx file contains developed countries from across regions (and some other random countries). We have tried to include the passages from all available laws that we have in these documents. There might be some missing countries or years. If you discover any, please let us know and we will update the files. (Both of us have worked on CBI for some time so there are a lot of background files.)

The Word documents are organized by country, then indicator and then the year of the central bank law. For example, here is the <i>term of office</i> indicator for Australia:
<b>AUSTRALIA</b>
<b>Chief Executive Officer (weight = .20)</b>
<i>(a)	Term of office</i>
<i>Australia 1959</i>: The Governor and the Deputy Governor: (a) shall be appointed by the Governor-General; (b) shall be appointed for such period, not exceeding 7 years, as the Governor-General determines but are eligible for re appointment; and (c) hold office subject to good behaviour. (Art. 24, 1)  <red>Coded as .75</red>
<i>Australia 2010</i>: (1)  The Governor and the Deputy Governor: 
 (a)  are to be appointed by the Treasurer; and
 (b)  shall be appointed for such period, not exceeding 7 years, as the Treasurer determines but are eligible for re appointment; and
 (c)  hold office subject to good behaviour. (Article 24) <red>Coded as .75</red>
<i>Australia 2021</i>: No change since 2010
